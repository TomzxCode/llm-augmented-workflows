# Claude Code Instructions

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Context

This repository uses automated workflows for issue planning and implementation:
- Issues trigger automatic plan generation
- Approved plans trigger automatic implementation
- Plans are reviewed via pull requests before implementation

## Workflow-Specific Guidelines

### When Generating Plans
- Explore the codebase thoroughly before proposing solutions
- Consider existing patterns and conventions
- Assess feasibility honestly - it's okay to say something isn't feasible
- Provide actionable, specific implementation steps
- Think about edge cases, error handling, and testing
- Estimate complexity realistically

### When Implementing Plans
- Follow the approved plan but use good judgment
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns
- Write clean, readable code with appropriate comments
- Consider performance and security implications
- Add or update tests as needed
- Update documentation for API changes

### When Responding to Review Comments
- Be collaborative and respectful
- Use judgment: update the plan if feedback improves it, discuss if it's exploratory
- Explain your reasoning clearly
- Be open to alternative approaches
- Keep responses concise but complete
